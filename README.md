# NLP assignments

This repository includes two assignments for the Natural Language Processing class of the M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna. In particular, the two projects are:

1. [Part of Speech (POS) tagging](part-of-speech-tagging): In this project different recurrent neural architectures are employed to perform sequence labeling on sentences taken from the dependency treebank dataset. 
2. [Fact checking](fact-checking): This project is centred on the fact checking task on the FEVER dataset, with the aims of determining whether a given statement (claim) conveys a trustworthy information or not, based on the clues contained in a given evidence.
